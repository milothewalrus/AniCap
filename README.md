# AniCap Project Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the AniCap project:

---

## Step 1: Create and Activate a Conda Environment

Open your terminal and run the following commands to create a new Conda environment named `anicap_env` with Python 3.12 and then activate it:

```bash
conda create --name anicap_env python=3.12 -y
conda activate anicap_env

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Make sure your requirements.txt file is in the project directory. Then install the required packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Tip: If you make changes to requirements.txt, simply re-run the above command to update your environment.

Step 3: Obtain an MP4 File of a Podcast Clip

Download or record an MP4 file of a podcast clip. Place the file in your project directory.

Step 4: Rename the File

Rename your MP4 file to input_video.mp4 (or the expected input filename by the script). For example, if your file is named podcast.mp4, run:

mv podcast.mp4 input_video.mp4

Step 5: Run the Python Script

Finally, run the AniCap Python script to process the video:

python AniCap.py

Additional Notes
	•	File Placement: Ensure that input_video.mp4 is located in the root of your project directory.
	•	Output: The script will generate an output video (output_video.mp4) with the animated captions.
	•	Troubleshooting: If you encounter any issues, double-check that your environment is active and all dependencies are correctly installed.

Happy coding!
